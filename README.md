A solution to the complex problems that I have solved in coding competitions


## ZAMKA

This is a problem I came across in the UB Coding Connundrum

Problem Description - 

The impossible has happened. Bear G. has fallen into his own trap. Lured by a delicious box of Domaćica, without even thinking, he rushed and fell into his trap. In order to get out of the trap, he must solve the following task with your help. You are given three integers 𝐿, 𝐷 and 𝑋.
 - determine the minimal integer 𝑁 such that 𝐿≤𝑁≤𝐷 and the sum of its digits is 𝑋
 - determine the maximal integer 𝑀 such that 𝐿≤𝑀≤𝐷 and the sum of its digits is 𝑋

## ATM

This is a Code-Chef problem encountered during a monthly cook-off.

Problem Description - 

Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.
