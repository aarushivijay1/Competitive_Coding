A solution to the complex problems that I have solved in coding competitions

Below is a description of these problems - 

## ZAMKA

This is a problem I came across in the UB Coding Connundrum

Problem Description - 

The impossible has happened. Bear G. has fallen into his own trap. Lured by a delicious box of Domaćica, without even thinking, he rushed and fell into his trap. In order to get out of the trap, he must solve the following task with your help. You are given three integers 𝐿, 𝐷 and 𝑋.
 - determine the minimal integer 𝑁 such that 𝐿≤𝑁≤𝐷 and the sum of its digits is 𝑋
 - determine the maximal integer 𝑀 such that 𝐿≤𝑀≤𝐷 and the sum of its digits is 𝑋

# CODECHEF

## ATM

This is a Code-Chef problem encountered during a monthly cook-off.

Problem Description - 

Pooja would like to withdraw X $US from an ATM. The cash machine will only accept the transaction if X is a multiple of 5, and Pooja's account balance has enough cash to perform the withdrawal transaction (including bank charges). For each successful withdrawal the bank charges 0.50 $US. Calculate Pooja's account balance after an attempted transaction.

## CHEFCCYL

Chef recently learned about finding shortest paths in a bidirectional graph. He has following types of graphs with him and would like to find shortest paths between some given pair of vertices.

There are N cycles in the graph. Let us enumerate them cycle number 1 to N. The i-th cycle contains Ai nodes enumerated from 1 to Ai.

The nodes of a single cycle are connected to each other in cyclic fashion, i.e. the 1st node is connected to 2nd, 2nd to 3rd, and so on till the last node is connected to the 1st node. All of these edges are weighed.

The cycles are also connected to each other via an edge in a similar cyclic order. The i-th cycle is connected to i % N + 1-th cycle via an edge. This edge is between some vertex v1 of i-th cycle and vertex v2 of i % N + 1-th cycle and is a weighted edge.

You are given Q queries, each containing four integers v1, c1, v2, c2. You have to find the weight of shortest path between the v1-th vertex of c1-th cycle, and v2-th vertex of c2-th cycle.
